# SyllabiQ – Backend Service
**Syllabus-Aware Educational AI using RAG & Multi-Agent Architecture**

---

## 📌 Overview

SyllabiQ is a backend service for a syllabus-aware educational AI platform designed to help college students with:
- syllabus-aligned Q&A
- exam-oriented explanations
- notes summarization
- practice question generation

The backend is built using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a **multi-agent orchestration layer** to ensure accuracy, control, and scalability.

The system does **not train or fine-tune** any language model.  
All intelligence is controlled using **retrieval, prompt orchestration, and guardrails at runtime**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Syllabus-Aware AI Responses
- Uses **manually curated syllabus and notes**
- Ensures responses stay within curriculum scope
- Prevents off-topic or over-detailed answers

---

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Knowledge stored in a **vector database**
- Only **relevant syllabus chunks** are retrieved per query
- Reduces hallucinations and improves factual grounding

---

### 3. Multi-Agent Architecture
The system decomposes intelligence into specialized agents:
- Intent understanding
- Knowledge retrieval
- Answer generation
- Validation & refinement

This improves reliability and explainability.

---

### 4. Exam-Oriented Output Control
- Supports 2-mark / 5-mark / 10-mark answers
- Structured output (bullet points, headings)
- Difficulty-controlled question generation

---

### 5. Guardrails & Safety
- Syllabus boundary enforcement
- Output length control
- Academic tone enforcement
- Hallucination reduction via RAG

## 🧠 Core System Components

### 1. API Layer (FastAPI)
- Handles HTTP requests
- Performs request validation
- Routes queries to orchestration layer
- Async and scalable

---

### 2. Orchestration Layer (LangChain)
- Manages agent execution order
- Handles prompt templates
- Coordinates retrieval + generation
- Acts as the “brain” of the system

---

### 3. Vector Knowledge Layer (RAG)
- Stores:
  - syllabus
  - unit-wise notes
  - curated study material
- Uses embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieves top‑K relevant chunks per query

---

### 4. LLM Invocation Layer
- Stateless LLM API calls
- Context-grounded generation only
- No memory, no training, no fine-tuning

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Design

### 🔹 1. Intent Classification Agent
**Responsibility**
- Understand user intent:
  - Concept explanation
  - Notes summarization
  - Practice question generation
  - Exam revision

**Output**
- Selected workflow type

---

### 🔹 2. Retrieval Agent
**Responsibility**
- Convert query into embeddings
- Query vector database
- Fetch relevant syllabus & notes

**Guarantee**
- AI sees only approved academic content

---

### 🔹 3. Generation Agent
**Responsibility**
- Generate response using:
  - Retrieved context
  - Prompt templates
  - Exam constraints

**Tools**
- LangChain prompt templates
- LLM API

---

### 🔹 4. Validation / Guardrail Agent
**Responsibility**
- Enforce:
  - syllabus relevance
  - answer length
  - academic tone
  - exam format

**May**
- Refine or regenerate response if needed

## 🔁 Workflow Orchestration

### 🧩 Workflow 1: Syllabus-Based Q&A

User Query
→ Intent Agent (Q&A)
→ Retrieval Agent (syllabus chunks)
→ Generation Agent
→ Validation Agent
→ Response


---

### 🧩 Workflow 2: Notes Summarization

User Notes
→ Intent Agent (summarization)
→ Retrieval Agent (related syllabus)
→ Generation Agent (summary)
→ Validation Agent
→ Response


---

### 🧩 Workflow 3: Practice Question Generation

User Topic + Difficulty
→ Intent Agent (question generation)
→ Retrieval Agent (topic content)
→ Generation Agent (MCQ / short / long)
→ Validation Agent
→ Response


---

## 🛡️ Guardrails Strategy

The system enforces guardrails at **multiple levels**:

### 1. Retrieval Guardrails
- Only approved syllabus data is retrievable
- No open-internet generation

---

### 2. Prompt Guardrails
- Explicit syllabus boundaries
- Exam-oriented formatting instructions
- Length and difficulty constraints

---

### 3. Post‑Generation Guardrails
- Output validation
- Refusal or regeneration on violations
- Removal of irrelevant content
